Backend API
What I Used
Node.js
JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
Express.js
A fast and minimal web framework for building RESTful APIs.
CORS
Middleware to handle cross-origin requests securely.
MongoDB
A NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
dotenv
Manage environment variables securely.
JSON Web Token (JWT)
For user authentication and authorization.
Why I Used Them
Node.js
Enables fast and lightweight server-side applications.
Uses JavaScript, allowing consistency between frontend and backend.
Express.js
Simplifies creating API endpoints and middleware.
Provides robust routing and HTTP utility methods.
CORS
Ensures secure communication between frontend and backend when hosted on different domains.
MongoDB
Schema-less structure supports rapid development.
Scales easily for modern applications.
dotenv
Keeps sensitive data (like API keys) out of source code.
Simplifies managing configurations across environments.
JWT
Ensures secure, stateless user authentication.
Tokens can be easily verified without storing sessions on the server.
Benefits
Scalability

The combination of Node.js, Express, and MongoDB ensures the backend is highly scalable and can handle high traffic.
Security

JWT secures authentication.
dotenv protects sensitive data.
CORS prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests.
Efficiency

Rapid development with Express.js and MongoDB.
Asynchronous handling in Node.js for improved performance.
Flexibility

MongoDB allows dynamic schema design.
Middleware in Express offers extensive customization options.
Portability

Environment configuration with dotenv ensures seamless deployment across different environments.
